<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This was created for the Titanic Competition on Kaggle. Using pandas and p, I created statistical models to predict the likelihood of passenger survival on cleaned data sheets and had an accuracy of 65-80% depending on what type of model was used. You can look at the Jupyter notebook created detailing the process <a href="https://github.com/ryan-c-hsu/titanicexercise/blob/master/main.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>

<p>After downloading the data set, I explored the general trends in the data to help create a point of reference when going back and cleaning the data set. So I would know if I'm missing some information, which age group or class that passenger was most likely to be in. After cleaning the data, I trained the algorithm on a subset of passengers. After that I ran it on the rest of the data set using models such as Random Forrest, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines. Lastly, I evaluated how well the models performed compared to the actual results and exported the data to excel files.</p>
